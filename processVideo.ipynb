second  okay  okay you so on the spot right  now okay wait I don't know if I can  right now but I'll I'll hit you when I  when it comes up okay okay okay okay it  is very difficult when put on the spot  to just be like  incred hey brother and welcome everyone  to the world's hardest alus personal  wolf for Brian Dumbledore quiz for the  first time maybe ever I literally almost  said hello brother instead of Hey  Brother for no reason whatsoever just  just forgot the words I was like yeah we  we counted in we're like let's go and I  was like oh I got halfway through the  word people might be able to see it if  they go back and watch it in an instant  replay I'm like what's up brother hey  brother hey we have I've done this  before anyway Dumbledore more  importantly how well do you think you  know this man I mean we've made a lot of  videos about Dumbledore if if there is  hopefully well but like there's like  tiny details that show up in these  quizzes that you're like yeah I guess  that's true I there's the inevitability  of the like what is the password to  Dumbledore's office in Harry's second  year and it's like I know it's candy I  know right it's like that does that mean  I know Dumbledore no it's just like an  adjacent Dumbledore fact but you are J  so ajacent facts tend to work in your  favor exactly yeah that's how it works  that's how it works all right let's dive  on  it hey  brother in case you guys are new to the  J versus Ben format this is how it is  going to work quiz AEL is on the other  end of the camera she's waving we can  see her but you can't she's going to be  reading us today standard 10 questions  plus additional live from our quiz  Masters over on patreon as usual Ben and  I have to answer all the questions  completely from memory which I'm feeling  good about cuz Ben just forgot hey  brother hello there uh but if we both  agree we have no idea we could get the  multiple choice from quiz AEL and if  you'd like to play along with us there's  a link in the description down below  quel how you doing I'm doing great Ben  how are you doing are you excited to be  here today I'm excited to be here every  day I like my job hey I like my job too  especially because of you guys oh man a  now I'm crying happy te happy tears you  can't see them cuz they're invisible  right and cuz the camera's not pointed  at you and not real and not real I'm not  real rolling what do you think who's  that M Moody is that  me it's Isabelle Isabelle for the folks  at home who have no idea what Isabelle  looks like that's basically it what did  you do I've added bangs but you can't  tell cuz it doesn't it doesn't work well  those two lines I kind of assumed were  bangs but I guess in hindsight it's ey  those are such epic bangs you're like  captured how  how ular her head  is almost as big as my head Arnold Hey  Arnold Hey Arnold that's really good Jay  from memory too thank  you okay is this better  Isabelle sorry hold  on no we're talking now we're just  buling now we're  talking it's like  no you have to show me it's like a  really scary like Jack a'  Lantern very bad very  bad I don't know you look pretty happy  about  it did you do something to your  hair Tim Burton is going call I will  never defeat the moaning mortal  allegations with that one 50 points if  it goes through her head question one  what job does alvus Dumbledore  repeatedly turn down oh oh all right you  ready got it three two one go Minister  for magic minister of magic of magic why  were you so concerned Ben well because I  always say Minister for magic because I  for whatever I think it's said that way  once it's in cursed child they say  Minister for magic in every every time  okay okay is that what it is you're both  correct it's otherwise minister of yes  Good Start Good Start let's go question  two how many turns of the time Turner  does Dumbledore suggest Harry and  Hermione should use to save Sirius and  buck beak wow we have zero banter yeah I  got  it okay you ready yeah one two  three it is always three it is three oh  man you paused for a while after that I  was like um  we're about to go into outrage mode um  well I feel like I can mess with you  guys at least 30% for those drawings so  what are you talking about those were  stunningly  accurate we are known for our  illustration capabilities they were  great they were great for people of our  skill all right question three our first  quiz Master question of the day this  question was submitted by Mischief  managers and voted on by patrons what  does Dumbledore say Dobby can call him  oh oh man I know it's like  a do you have it I I know like the first  two words I like that's a reach for it  you can get it come on I can't it's like  I can go in the room in my brain and  like find like you know the scene but  maybe if you guys put your foreheads  together your brain cell will spark our  brain cell I would go multiple choice  okay yeah oh man just cuz I don't I'm  not going to remember the last word all  right is it a a looney old buffer b a  batty old conquer C A Bary old codger or  D A daff old galute you think that  helped yeah yeah that helped Ben doesn't  look so so so you don't look so sold  yeah yeah is they're good fake  answers a  sir of course sir of course an elf I'm  an elf you got something I got something  yeah ready 3 two 1 c c it is c yeah but  Dobby was not wanting to  but oh man what a good giving Dobby a  sock a sock Dobby is a free Elf oh Dobby  hster man I will tell you what the scene  in the movie when Dobby  dies not in my question four why was  Dumbledore avoiding Harry during the  majority of his fifth year at  Hogwarts um Jinx buy me a coke oh no no  no no talking I I feel like he gives a  pretty wishy-washy answer for this the  real answer is cuz it would have made  things too easy for Harry if he could  have talked to Dumbledore if he could  just  Dumbledore questions look at me that's  actually that's another that's another  good moment yeah so I I think like I'm  using a word here but I think it's I  don't know I I would argue my case if  needed okay um all right so three two  one so he's afraid Voldemort would  attack him through Harry yeah I said spy  but like I mean like take use the shared  connection to yeah disadvantage  Dumbledore I mean yes but you I would  say you're both correct cat specifically  wrote he was afraid Voldemort would use  Harry against him SLP possess him okay I  would say you guys nailed it okay yeah  huz you're contact is apparently where  it's at seems like dor still could have  just been like Harry just don't look at  me in the eye yes yes ask me any  question you need we have a shade here  in the in the suite have a [ __ ] yeah  exactly talk to me through the wall yeah  yeah they have like a confession Booth  right yes something like that yeah seems  like there are ways around this you know  it does feel that way you could write  owls to each other right yeah a great  idea well that would be too easy for  Harry if he could just talk to  Dumbledore yes exactly question five  which member of the gaun family did  Dumbledore seek out for information and  memories about Tom  Riddle yeah okay yeah yeah right right  no problem maybe no problem most most  likely I feel good about it me too all  right 3 two 1 Morphin isn't it It's  morphin but it's spelled with an F uh is  it that's what this says I don't know  things okay well also but I would say  just per the phrasing of the question I  would say he probably seeks out all of  them this is just the only one he can  get  a yeah okay okay you know I mean fair  fair you are without doubt the wor cuz  marolo has already died in asan yeah I  guess so is moroi yeah yeah yeah talking  to mopi certainly would have been that  would been tricky that would have been  really I mean couldn't you just time  turn her back then and talk to her no no  against that first child just decided to  do whatever it wanted to and right it's  like n you want you just go like 10  years back it's fine yeah it's cool yeah  question six our second quiz Master  question of the day this question was  submitted by Ben Henderson and voted on  by patrons how many goblets of potion  does Dumbledore have to drink to get the  hor Crux in the cave oh my goodness how  many man how many jets 36 counted them  myself how many boy you know what  bothers me here is that afterwards Harry  tries all these different ways to give  him water except pointing his wand like  right in his mouth and going like ATI  and just be like he he'll be like agenti  into the cup and then the cup doesn't  work but like just go straight why why  bother with the cup at all yeah you're  like a like a water fountain it's too  bad that dador is not like a Stanley gal  with his like Stanley Cup why didn't he  bring his own cup it's like and then dor  reached into the folds of his robe and  pulled out a stainless steel double wall  insulated container exactly exactly this  is just like magic feels like something  he should have been prepared for and  candy apple yellow and candy apple yell  that's definitely his color do you think  he has stickers probably I do yeah for  sure he has stickers probably one that  says Potter stinks but he like modified  it say like Potter rules right yeah yeah  that sounds he he just like I support  all the students Harry okay you know you  just get to be on the on the bottle like  you're my favor but I still have to like  support everyone and drink it was  student here and he's doing this whole I  got a whole side project with him you'll  see in like a couple hours this going be  don't worry about it it all make sense  don't worry about it I'm not going to  die I will die no I didn't say  that Snape trust him Professor Snape  Harry you got  it I'm  dying it's like I was there I know let's  just replace the movie footage with that  forever exactly just come back from me  to d r Cliff at the  cave oh  okay so anyway how many goblets oh man I  forgot we had or  seashells does he need to drink so all I  can imagine here is that the number  itself is not specifically listed yeah  it's just sort of like if you were  keeping track yeah if like you wanted to  go through the page and be like one so  all we can do therefore  is guess you know all right you ready  one two 3 it's always seven it's always  seven it's not seven man it's usually  almost always seven it's 12 12 okay I  was going to write eight and then I was  like if I'm going for eight I may as  well go for seven you may as well the  thing is though is that he almost has to  have one of those Stanley Cups because  12 goblets of any fluid I mean like I  mean yeah right a lot a lot he's like  got to go to the bathroom man right  right right you know he's up on the  tower stall a mouthful like please get  to the bathroom please KY just like  agree to the terms oh boy stumblor is  not slipping down the wall because he's  slowly dying in real time he just has to  pee so bad 12 goblets  Draco could you imagine if it even even  inside of the cave it's like you've got  like all the water all around right and  then out in the middle is like the  little thing and like here's like the  pedestal where the thing is or whatever  and they're like standing over here you  know just chilling like this and then  like over here there's like a porta John  yeah I can't wait to see okay there you  go oh love love it so yeah it's just  like so like Dumbledore is like you know  like walking out of here with like a  piece of toilet paper stuck to  his Voldemort is like he puts the drink  in despair there but it's like but  here's the thing like they're going to  have to go so right it's like Lord  some All is fair and Love and War I  don't want them to go in my Lake right  exactly don't go in my Lake right that's  the thing like you're going to be here a  while don't like don't go on the floor  like I'm going to be walking there right  right you think he goes back ever well  dumor says that he would want the person  to survive so that he could arrive to  question them to figure out how they  found out about the horr before killing  them exactly that's why the drink of  Despair Doesn't Kill You Yes science  right so yes convenient yeah Yeah Yeah  question seven who wrote Alba  Dumbledore's obituary do you need like  nickname in the middle or anything or  I'm putting it in there you putting it  in there I I don't think I do but I'll  take it all right all  right one two three elus dog breath  nose you are correct eat her so mean she  is so so mean although it seems like  once again a good a good time to be like  maybe elus was the inventor of Dogecoin  probably he was take her to the moon for  me no doubt he's like he's like really  big on Magic but also like an early  adopter of cryptocurrency he just like  got like one footed like muggle yeah  stock trading and stuff yes yeah it's  like you know you can make money over  there they got stuff you can buy it's  all about alternative currencies right  like we don't know when The Wizarding  bank system is going to collapse it  could be at any point right you have to  put it in reliable crypto muggle  currency precisely exactly well hey I  mean green gos isn't to be trusted  anymore so that's true that's true I  mean it's been broken into at least  twice at least twice yeah safest place  ever it's just like they have all these  like they're like safest place in the  Wizard World it's just like the bar is  just not actually that high though it's  like the Wizard World just dangerous  it's just dangerous you know they're  saying safest but like out of 10 safest  is still like Hogwarts is like a four  it's like it's like one of the houses in  like the Saw movies it's like this is  the safest safest room in the house  it's full of syringes right but like  it's the safest it's the safest one just  don't touch any of them just don't touch  them speak parcel tongue and don't open  the Chamber of Secrets don't get thrown  into the pit of syringes it happens  don't have the Dementors come kiss you  while you're on your broom and fall like  presumably what should be to your death  but somehow survive magic sure question  eight when the ministry of magic  threatened to strip Dumbledore of his  accolades in order of the Phoenix what  is the only thing he cares to keep got  it I'm sure you do to though yeah ready  yeah 3 two one as long as I keep him on  the chocolate frog cards that's correct  yeah yeah the fun theory behind that is  the possibility that Dumbledore uses the  chocolate frog cards as a way to  communicate with all the other members  of the Order of the Phoenix so it's like  it doesn't actually super matter to him  necessarily but like it's also using  like candy which is like a very like  Dumbledore thing like a way to like  communicate because like that's the type  of stuff like Voldemort doesn't  understand  understand yeah and it's like  Dumbledore's chocolate frog card like  actually has him appearing in and out of  the portrait we can't expect him to hang  out there all day it's like that you  know but like the other Wizarding  pictures are like that so you kind of  can and they say we have ways of  communicating that are better than theor  Suri's fireplace and it's like we don't  know what those other ways are but a  good way most likely frog cards it's  also like Hermione uses like like the  protein charm yep on the coins yeah yeah  do you think Voldemort was always like  really upset that he he wasn't going to  be on one like you think that was part  of his goal he was like I take over the  world and then I get on the freaking  card right yeah at some point in his  plan like after he takes over Hogwarts  is like I'm talking to Chocolate frog  people I'm getting on that card I'm  getting on the card in fact on the card  I'm the only one who will be on cards  from now that's it they're all Voldemort  I got about six of him oh man I got  Voldemort again the people that CH FR  all company are like you know it kind of  misses the point like people want to buy  more to get more cards and he's like no  they get more me they get more that's  all there is how bad could I possibly be  let's see you think he changed them to  Chocolate snakes chocolate snakes for  sure he did and then they kind of just  look like turds oh man but they still  Slither they still Slither yikes those  are the worst kind of  turds question nine our third quiz  Master question this question was  submitted by Tara Walker a pisy and dumb  genius and voted on by patrons after  being cursed by the ring Dumbledore said  that the death was coming for him as  surely as what Quidditch team will  finish at the bottom of the  league oh man should we do it in song  form yeah yes three two one the C the C  boom boom boom We  Pirates I so hope

Goblet of Fire to  sure students can't trick it tricket  it's fun to  say it's like that Cracker trisuit it's  always age old question what do I do  while you guys sit in silence and write  it's like do I say something do I feel  the void Isabelle starts like her own  like little show where it's like all  right well the guys are writing so let  me pick up where I left off yeah where  were we yeah where were we I got to get  the fame started now so I got to use the  the time that I have you know there you  go use that platform Ethan's going to  cut all my segments  all right you got it all right yep three  two one said draw an AG line around it  draw an AG line around it yeah yeah  that's correct Y no one thinks to like  when levosa the paper across it you know  or like do do you think that work throw  it yeah I don't see why not I mean Harry  does he does throw that firework into  the potion in year two yeah when they're  breaking into Snape's office for the  poly juice stuff it seems or apparently  also what could have worked is just  giving your name to an older student and  letting them walk  across that would have worked yeah well  cuz he he asked he's like did you have  one of the older students do it for you  yeah like I didn't think anyone would to  think of that  yeah I thought of everything moody moody  is able to walk up and do it and he just  puts Harry's name in I guess that's true  you know and his his the way his way  around it isn't circumventing the age  line cuz he's old enough he just  confundes the thing itself yeah that's  true that's a good point that would have  worked if anyone could have just thought  of that at all that's fair but then you  would need somebody to like agree to do  it for you doesn't seem that hard some  somebody in high school would do it yeah  someone would do it I mean George had  been of age they totally would have done  it yeah exactly exactly true there got  to be some other hooligan willing  question 11 what flavor of Birdie box  every flavored Bean did Dumbledore tell  Harry he was unfortunate enough to taste  in his youth oh  boom  alas wax that was good it was like yeah  yeah yeah he's like still chewing in  he's like this is the fun oh this is the  yeah right yeah well you you lose some  you lose some  more I love that wizard candy is like  hey it's going to be mildly inconvenient  but you're still going to buy it I know  like wizard candy doesn't like they  always make it sound so fun to like have  wizard candy but like there doesn't seem  to often be that many upsides to wizard  candy yeah it's like it's always kind of  like a prank right yeah yeah right it's  like I don't know why why muggle candy  wouldn't still just be great it's like  chocolate frog super fun get the cards  the but but the Frog can escape right  right you know like you might not get  the chocolate not to mention just like  you have to eat like a squirming  chocolate frog you think he's got like  chocolate guts chocolate guts I hope  bite open is like oh no his chocolate  heart fell out oh that would be so sad  do you think it's like like the the  squishy chocolate inside or do you think  it's like dense I don't know I one of my  least favorite things about the  chocolate frogs they sell at um  Universal is that it's like a brick it's  it's like too much chocolate yeah I  agree my least favorite thing about  those chocolate frogs is all of it yeah  yeah except for the card they should be  smaller and more delicious yes and still  come in the same box I feel like if they  were that like thin chocolate they would  taste so much better like like you bite  into it and it almost like cracks cracks  because it's like Hollow okay because it  has chocolate organs inside I was  thinking like air like air like air you  want a hollow frog I'd rather have that  than like the brick maybe it should be  more like a frog a fudge frog I feel  like it should be fudge would be good  like a truffle like a truffle kind of  thing yeah like a truffle like but it's  a frog yes okay now we're cooking with  gas also I'm trying to remember this  line because I stalling I am well  actually you guys are distracting me  from thinking no it's okay I'm just  trying to think that let's see  cuz but and now I'm thinking of like all  the various ones that like I know like  Fred swears he got a bogey flavored one  and there's  like imagine just a sweet treat and you  like get like a booger flavored jelly  this is already the problem with Jelly  Bellies though like they're already like  if you just get random assortment like  yeah half of them are bad half of them  are bad even if they're supposed to be  good like there's you can't like pop  like a handful of Jelly Bellies into  your mouth cuz like that's a terrible  idea right it's like it's like squishing  a whole bunch of Play-Doh together you  just send up with like grayish Brown  exactly you don't want that you got to  like then you got to narrow  in why I mean I just feel like jelly  beans in general don't taste very good I  like Starburst jelly beans minus the  purple ones just purple yeah minus the  purple ones they have purple ones yeah  you probably don't remember cuz you  didn't eat them cuz they're terrible  well while Ben thanks allow me to tell  you about my awesome shirt right here  which you may notice looks a lot like  the painting behind us cuz it is that  painting we just modified it to look  like Pride colors cuz this is our pride  shirt for this year it is available  right now at Carl Brothers  mercantile.com there you go all the  proceeds donated to the Rono diversity  Council oh you can pull that out of your  head yeah yeah good oh good what is a  bad  flavor what would taste bad what would  not be good what would taste bad oh my  gosh did I just snort one of  these just I just laugh so hard I blew  it out with my nose exhale oh no it's  going to burn unevenly now oh man get  this man some matches don't know I don't  know this is not it I just I know it's  not it this is something else three two  one vomit flavored one it's vomit yeah  it is okay but here's the thing is vomit  can tastes like a lot of different  things that's kind of ambiguous why  would they even make a vomit flavored  one why would they even do it why that's  not like that's not fun at all like it's  just going to make people not buy them  do you think it'll make people vomit I'm  actually probably flashbacks to the  danger beans wheel of punishment they  are really really bad like I feel like  like actually like evoke like real n  like imagine if like that wasn't a known  thing you like subscribed to when you  bought the Jelly Bellies that was just  all Jelly Belly bags ever might have  those flavors yeah I would never eat  them it's a ter this like it's such a  fun product when you're reading about it  and like here and Ron are eating them  but in real life no I just had a thought  I feel like the way that it works is  that whatever the flavor is it is just  something that makes you vomit a little  bit Ah so it's like amortentia but like  vomit flavor right yeah exactly okay  okay next Quest all right question 12  our fourth quizmas question of the day  this question was submitted by key Ray  and ji and voted on by patrons what did  Dumbledore order for dinner at the Ule  ball  mhm Ben has a smirk he's back I'm back  he's back going yeah all right you ready  three two one pork chops pork chops it  is pork chops yeah it  is huzzah nothing get you in the mood  for some dancing like pork chops like  pork chops pork chops when good are  amazing are frequently otherwise very  dry very dry easy to overcook this is so  true yeah anytime I go to somebody's  house and they're like all right we're  having pork chops for dinner I'm like oo  this is a gamble like oh boy man all  right I'm either going to have to lie to  you or I'm going to have a great night  yes yes this could go well or  poorly question  13 where was the first country alus  Dumbledore and elfus Doge were planning  on visiting during their grand tour  after graduating from Hogwarts oh the  first country they were  planning I'll go multiple choice okay  all right yeah this is what came to M  but I don't think it's right okay is it  a France B B Italy C Spain or D Greece  oh man so not my  guess at  all none of these feel quite as  like  International yeah they're prob like  sort of close by they're all sort of  this would be like as an American being  like yes I'm going on my my grand World  Tour I'm going to cansas  even Canada's too  like far out of America I mean like  we're like a bunch of tiny little  countries we are are yeah America is  just geographically quite large huge  okay um um so is Canada but you can only  live in like 2% of it yeah that's true  okay I have a guess I have a guess three  two one Greece I said Greece too it is  gree yeah boy I almost went France man  my guess was Bhutan that would have re  you would have been very wrong I  Cambodia came to mind for me so so we  were both just way off the map  definitely nowhere they were actually  going to go play Survivor so they were  going to go to like Nicaragua and play  Survivor for 30 days Survivor is mostly  played in Fiji these days yeah they  zeroed in yeah got like a local yeah  they're just sort of I think they were  just like you know what the game isn't  about where we are it's about the game  yeah let's just like stop moving the  whole set around we'll just use the same  islands and we'll have the same permits  and we'll have the same Beach is and  it's fine that doesn't affect your  viewing pleasure yeah but this was this  that would have been like in like recent  seasons of Survivor

like several of  these questions have come from the same  chapter yeah um or at least Deathly  Hallows because you've got like the Rita  sker article and the Alish Doge yeah  uh the obituary the yeah like that that  answer also would have come from like  the alesto obituary yes yeah  mhm all right Ben you you can you can  retie so that we can untie again okay  you want a tiebreaker I do but I don't  know what it'll be so it'll really put  me on the spot  so it is time for question 15 our fifth  quiz Master question of the day this  question was submitted by Mr Legends and  law ninja and voted on by patrons  according to the last line of his  chocolate frog card what two things does  Dumbledore enjoy pretty sure this is  right I'm pretty sure I got it  um man we are going Just So Into the  Depths I know this  one's I think I I I'm afraid I'm  blanking on  one I think I  just it is only two things I know I know  I I I feel very certain about one and I  can't think of what the other is you got  it yeah I have a guess  three two one chamber music and 10 Pin  bowling oh my gosh it is 10 Pin bowling  and chamber music yes oh I had I had  Opera written down and I changed it to  chamber music oh no wow it's not just  Ben who's done that now my excitement  for  winning man woo man I just I was like I  was totally cross word braining that one  I was like I bro sounds right I feel  like he does like Opera vomit and  chamber there you go chamber music and  vomit all you need to know about  Dumbledore two words cost me today's  victory yeah wow and they're both  they're both kind of things you could do  in bathrooms you think chamber music is  bathroom music well like a chamber room  is a bathroom right chamber pots I'm  picking more like entrance chamber or  something entrance chamber yeah where do  you play chamber music yeah or is it  like like elevator music chamber music  sounds like like church music I think  what even is chamber music what even is  chamber music is it like when one person  stands on stage and annunciates rather  loudly like across a massive vocal  range what would be opera music oh okay  that a joke on my answer you know what  would be chamber about that yeah so  chamber that's that is so chamber right  now darn it okay well no tiebreaker  necessary not today I'm sorry guys so  instead I won by two you did win by two  yes oh booya
